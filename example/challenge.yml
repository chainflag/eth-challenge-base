  We design a pretty easy contract challenge. Enjoy it!
  Your goal is to make isSolved() function returns true!

flag: flag{placeholder}

constructor:
  args: ["hello"]
  value: 0
  #gas: 1000000          # The default value is the response value of the eth_estimateGas JSON-RPC

#show_source: False      # Show source option available by default, you need to set False for a reverse contract challenge

#solved_event: SendFlag  # The default is to use isSolved() view function as solved checker, but emitted event checker is also supported

#deployed_addr: 0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7  # Use a pre-deployed contract for all players instead of deploying individually
