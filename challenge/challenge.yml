  We design a pretty easy contract game. Enjoy it!
  1. Create a game account
  2. Deploy a game contract
  3. Request for flag
  4. Get source code
  Option 1, get an account which will be used to deploy the contract;
  Before option 2, please transfer some eth to this account (for gas);
  Option 2, the robot will use the account to deploy the contract for the challenge;
  Option 3, use this option to obtain the flag when isSolved() function returns true;
  Option 4, use this option to get source code.
  You can finish this challenge in a lot of connections.
